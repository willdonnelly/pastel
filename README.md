Pastel Roadmap
==============

(In some order roughly like this)

  * Tweak performance of the graphics primitives.

  * Possibly move `rawOutput` into Draw.Utils, as it's not
    really a viable output method on its own.

  * Start looking into implementing a WxWidgets draw method.

  * PNG files would be useful to output, too.
  
  * Maybe integrade with the Haskell GD bindings?

  * Write an actual README

  * Upload on github

  * We'll need to read input from files eventually, too.

  * Learn more about separating IO modules from the rest of
    the library, so I can build it without GTK if I choose.

  * Win32 support might be a plus

  * Upload to hackage
